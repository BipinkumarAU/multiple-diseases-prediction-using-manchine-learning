Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

Git

Steps
Clone the repository

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/BipinkumarAU/multiple-diseases-prediction-using-manchine-learning.git
cd multiple-diseases-prediction-using-manchine-learning
Install dependencies

bash

Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare the models

If you're including pre-trained models (.pkl files) in models/, skip to step 4.

Otherwise, refer to the training notebooks in notebooks/ and run them to generate models.

Run the application

bash
Copy
Edit
python app/app.py
Then navigate to http://localhost:5000 (or another port if specified).

Usage
Launch the application in your browser.

Enter patient data into the input fields.

Choose the disease prediction option.
